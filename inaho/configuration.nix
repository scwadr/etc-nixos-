  # This option defines the first version of NixOS you have installed on this particular machine,

  # even if you've upgraded your system to a new NixOS release.
  #
  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,

  # to actually do that.
  #
  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is
  # out of date, out of support, or vulnerable.

  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,

  #
  #         We generally consider a service or software commercial, when it is only
  #         intended to be available (beyond free trials or other restrictions) via
  #         a one-time payment, subscription, account registration or similar.
  #         Funding the development through donations or optional support contracts
  #         does not make the software itself commercial.
  #
  #         Fedora Linux, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux all would not be
  #         considered commercial by us, neither would e.g. Debian, Ubuntu or
  #         elementary OS. However, RedHat Enterprise Linux and various SUSE Linux
  #         Enterprise versions would be considered commercial.
