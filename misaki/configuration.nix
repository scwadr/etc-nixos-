  #         We generally consider a service or software commercial, when it is only
  #         intended to be available (beyond free trials or other restrictions) via
  #         a one-time payment, subscription, account registration or similar.
  #         Funding the development through donations or optional support contracts
  #         does not make the software itself commercial.
  #
  #         Fedora Linux, CentOS Stream, Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux all would not be
  #         considered commercial by us, neither would e.g. Debian, Ubuntu or
  #         elementary OS. However, RedHat Enterprise Linux and various SUSE Linux
  #         Enterprise versions would be considered commercial.
